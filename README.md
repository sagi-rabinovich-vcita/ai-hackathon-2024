# Hackathon Tutorial

Welcome to the Hackathon Tutorial! This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up a cloud development environment and completing various steps to build a demo project to simulate a chat application with our Vcita's AI Platfrom API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A vcita business API token.

## Getting Started

To get started with the tutorial, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).
2. Create a new workspace:  
  2.1 Click "Start for free".  
  2.2 Click "Create a Sandbox".   
3. In the workspace, locate the `index.html` file and replace it with the provided `index.html` file.
4. Similarly, locate the `styles.css` file and replace it with the provided `styles.css` file.

## Working with `index.ts`

The next step involves working with the `index.ts` file. Follow these steps:

1. Copy the contents of `index_step_00.ts`.
2. Navigate to the `src` folder in your workspace.
3. Open the `index.ts` file.
4. Paste the copied contents into the `index.ts` file, replacing any existing content.
5. Take some time to understand the functionality that has been implemented.
6. Move on to `index_step_01_create_chat.ts`, copy and paste its contents into `index.ts`, replacing any existing functions.
7. Repeat this process for each step, understanding and testing the newly added functionality.

Remember to test and experiment with each step to fully grasp the changes made.

## Next Steps

Happy hacking!
